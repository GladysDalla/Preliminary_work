# Ethical Considerations

## Guiding Principles

This research is grounded in **Design Justice** and **respect for research participants**, even when those participants are represented by their public online posts rather than direct engagement.

### Core Commitments

1. **Do no harm:** Protect privacy and dignity of care workers
2. **Respect autonomy:** Users did not consent to academic research when posting
3. **Benefit sharing:** Research should ultimately serve care worker communities
4. **Transparency:** Methods and limitations openly documented

## Data Source Ethics

### Reddit as Research Site

**Platform characteristics:**
- Public forum accessible without login
- Community guidelines emphasize anonymity
- Users aware content is publicly visible
- No expectation of privacy for public posts

**Ethical considerations:**
- Posts are public, but users may not anticipate academic research use
- Pseudonymous usernames provide some protection
- Content reflects vulnerable moments and sensitive experiences
- Power imbalance: Researchers extract value from workers' unpaid emotional labor

### Ethical Protocol for Reddit Data

**What we do:**
✓ Only access publicly available posts (no private messages, restricted subreddits)  
✓ Do not collect or retain usernames  
✓ Remove all identifying details from quotes before any use  
✓ Report only aggregate statistics publicly  
✓ Store raw data securely and privately  
✓ Follow Reddit API terms of service  
✓ Respect r/CNA community norms and guidelines  

**What we don't do:**
✗ Contact users directly  
✗ Screenshot posts (preserves anonymity better)  
✗ Link to specific posts in publications  
✗ Include enough detail to identify individual posters  
✗ Quote extensively (avoids attribution risk)  
✗ Share raw data publicly  

## Privacy Protection

### Anonymization Procedures

**Level 1: Automated (during collection)**
- Usernames not stored in dataset
- Only post content, metadata (score, date) retained
- URLs stored temporarily for verification, deleted after analysis

**Level 2: Manual (during analysis)**
For any quotes selected for publication:
- Remove workplace names (e.g., "Sunset Care" → "my facility")
- Remove geographic identifiers (e.g., "Milwaukee" → [deleted])
- Remove names of coworkers, managers (e.g., "Sharon" → "my manager")
- Remove unique identifying details (unusual incidents, rare conditions)
- Generalize temporal markers (e.g., "last Tuesday" → "recently")

**Level 3: Contextual assessment**
- Could this quote be traced back to poster through post history? → Paraphrase further
- Does combination of details create identifiability? → Remove details
- Is the quote necessary or can concept be conveyed differently? → Summarize instead

**Example transformation:**

**Original post:**
> "I'm a CNA at Brookside Manor in Portland. My manager Janet told me to download Calm after I had a panic attack during my double shift last week. Haven't opened it once. Just applied to 12 jobs on Indeed."

**Anonymized version:**
> [CNA, online forum 2023] "My manager suggested I download a meditation app. Haven't opened it. Meanwhile, I'm actively job searching."

### De-Identification Standards

Following HIPAA Safe Harbor principles (adapted for online research):
- No names or usernames
- No geographic subdivisions smaller than state
- No dates more specific than year
- No unique identifying numbers
- No photos or images
- No any other unique identifying characteristic

## Informed Consent Considerations

### Consent Challenges

**Traditional consent not obtained because:**
- Posts pre-exist research (no opportunity to consent before posting)
- Contacting users could breach their anonymity
- Users interact with community, not researchers

**Ethical justification for proceeding:**
- Data is publicly accessible
- Research serves public good (improving care worker support)
- Privacy protections exceed platform defaults
- No sensitive data disclosed beyond what users made public
- Risk minimized through anonymization

### Ethical Framework Applied

**Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR) Guidelines:**

*"The greater the vulnerability of the community/author/participant, the greater the obligation of the researcher to protect the community/author/participant."*

**Our application:**
- Care workers are vulnerable population (economic precarity, workplace power dynamics)
- Therefore: Extra care in anonymization, aggregate reporting, benefit orientation

## Research Positionality

### Researcher Role

**Position:** Outside researcher, volunteer, technologist

**NOT a member of care worker community:**
- Not a CNA or direct care worker
- Different educational/economic position
- Access to resources care workers may lack

**Implications:**
- Risk of misinterpretation (outsider perspective)
- Power imbalance (extracting knowledge from community)
- Responsibility to ensure benefits flow back to community

### Addressing Power Dynamics

**Strategies:**
1. **Transparency:** Open about positionality and limitations
2. **Humility:** Frame findings as preliminary, not definitive
3. **Community benefit:** Research designed to inform worker-centered interventions
4. **Future participation:** Dissertation will include direct worker voice (interviews, co-design)
5. **Advocacy:** Use platform to amplify worker experiences and needs

## Potential Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Re-identification

**Risk:** Someone could identify themselves or others in quotes/patterns

**Mitigation:**
- Heavy anonymization of all quotes
- No unique identifying details
- Aggregate statistics only
- No direct post links

**Residual risk:** Low, but not zero

### Risk 2: Misrepresentation

**Risk:** Researcher interpretation may not reflect poster intent

**Mitigation:**
- Member checking with CNAs outside study sample
- Thick description with context
- Limitations acknowledged
- Avoid overinterpretation

### Risk 3: Exploitation

**Risk:** Extracting knowledge from workers' unpaid emotional labor

**Mitigation:**
- Research explicitly aims to benefit care worker community
- Findings used to advocate for worker needs
- Dissertation will compensate participants fairly
- Credit community as knowledge source

### Risk 4: Platform Terms Violation

**Risk:** Violating Reddit API terms of service

**Mitigation:**
- Reviewed and complied with Reddit API terms
- Rate limiting respected
- Public data only
- No commercial use

## Data Management

### Storage

**During collection/analysis:**
- Raw data on encrypted local drive
- Not synced to cloud services
- Access limited to researcher only

**After publication:**
- Raw data deleted
- Only aggregate results retained
- Anonymized quotes kept for verification

### Sharing

**Publicly available:**
- Aggregate statistics
- Anonymized quotes
- Code and methodology

**Not shared:**
- Raw dataset with post IDs
- Usernames (never collected)
- URL links to original posts
- Any identifiable information

## IRB Status

### Current Status

**Not formally reviewed** - This is preliminary exploratory work for PhD applications

**Anticipated classification:** Exempt
- Publicly available data
- No identifiers retained
- Minimal risk

### Future Research

Dissertation research will:
- Seek formal IRB approval before data collection
- Include informed consent for interviews
- Compensate participants
- Provide clear opt-out procedures
- Follow institutional ethics protocols

## Ethical Tensions

### Acknowledged Dilemmas

**1. Public vs. Private**
- Posts are public, but users may not anticipate research use
- Balancing: Treat as more private than legal status requires

**2. Representation vs. Protection**
- Authentic quotes are compelling evidence
- Anonymization may alter meaning
- Balancing: Prioritize protection over perfect representation

**3. Extraction vs. Contribution**
- Researchers gain (publications, degrees)
- Workers may not directly benefit
- Balancing: Explicit commitment to translating research to advocacy/policy

## Community Accountability

### Commitments

1. **Results sharing:** Make findings accessible to care worker communities (not just academic journals)

2. **Advocacy:** Use research to support worker organizing and policy change

3. **Future inclusion:** Dissertation will center worker voice through direct participation

4. **Ongoing reflection:** Continuously assess whether research serves community interests

---

**This research operates under the principle that care workers' experiences, even when shared in public forums, deserve respect, protection, and ultimately, should inform interventions that genuinely serve their needs.**
