# Ethical Considerations

## Data Source
- Public Reddit posts from r/CNA
- No password-protected or private content
- Community discussion forum with 18k+ members

## Privacy Protection
1. **No usernames collected or retained**
2. **All quotes anonymized** - identifying details removed
3. **No direct links** to original posts in research outputs
4. **Aggregate statistics only** in public outputs

## Research Ethics
- Follows established protocols for internet research (AoIR guidelines)
- IRB exemption anticipated (public data, no identifiers)
- Respects Reddit API terms of service
- Acknowledges community norms of r/CNA

## Limitations
- Analysis limited to English-language posts
- Sample represents only Reddit users (selection bias)
- Cannot verify demographic claims in posts
- Preliminary/exploratory analysis only

## Researcher Positionality
- Researcher is not a CNA
- Volunteer experience at long-term care facility (17 months)
- Background in information systems, not healthcare
- Approaching from HCI/information behavior perspective
