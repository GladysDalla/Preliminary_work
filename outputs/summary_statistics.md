## Summary

**Primary Finding:** Despite active discussion of stress (8.2%), coping (22.5%), and extensive technology engagement (460 app mentions), wellness apps appear in only 1.6% of posts. Care workers instead discuss economic solutions (31.3%), peer validation (30.2%), and structural workplace stressors (financial: 45.3%; scheduling: 43.7%).

**Implication:** Wellness interventions designed for individual stress management are fundamentally misaligned with care workers' reality of structural, economic stressors requiring collective and economic responses.
